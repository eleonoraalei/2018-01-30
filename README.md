# Extending Python with C and C++

I will introduce on the use on Cython as an easy way to extends Python 
with C/C++ code.

We will use Cython in a Jupyter notebook, with Python 3.6, inside the [Anaconda environment](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).  
At your terminal prompt type:
```
conda install cython
```


Additionally, Cython needs the C compiler, so you should get it for you OS
+ **Linux**: get gcc from repository
+ **MacOS**: get Apple XCode from DVD or http://developer.apple.com 
+ **Windows**: use the open source MinDW. Cython documentation has an appendix on this (http://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/tutorial/appendix.html).
