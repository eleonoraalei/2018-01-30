# Extending Python with C and C++

I will introduce on the use on Cython as an easy way to extends Python 
with C/C++ code.

We will use Cython in a Jupyter notebook, with Python 3.6, inside the [https://www.anaconda.com/download/](Anaconda environment).  
In case you use `conda`, install Cython. At your terminal prompt type:
```
conda install cython
```
